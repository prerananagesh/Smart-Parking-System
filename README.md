# 🚗 Smart Parking System (IoT + Computer Vision)

An IoT-based parking automation system using Python, OpenCV, and ESP32 microcontroller. It detects vehicle number plates and allocates parking slots automatically.

## 🚀 Overview
- Language: Python, C++
- Hardware: ESP32 microcontroller, Ultrasonic Sensors
- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy
- Accuracy: ~95% for license plate recognition

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time slot availability detection.
- Automatic gate control using ESP32.
- License plate recognition for authenticated entry.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
Python • OpenCV • ESP32 • IoT • Computer Vision

## 🧾 Results
Reduced parking time by **40%** through automation and real-time updates.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Run the Python script for image detection.  
3. Upload ESP32 code from `/esp_code/` to microcontroller.  
4. Use camera input to detect and allocate slots.
